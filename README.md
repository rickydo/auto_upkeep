auto_upkeep
===========

My personal rails app for car maintenance logging.
This app is a work in progress so there will be bugs.
The story behind this app is that I do the majority of the work on my car.
As a result, I always lose track of what I've done to the car.
Autoupkeep is meant to be a digital database so that I no longer have to keep track of things I've done on a piece of cardboard, a notebook, notes app on ipad. 

I fully intend make this app functional. For the time being it will just a be a mobile responsive web app that a user can add records to. 

My plans are to have a sort feature on the record table so that it can sort by type of fluid, date.

Maybe I can add a part price field for future comparison.
